		<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
		<br>
		<p>My name is Aditya Dabhi, an international student from India. 
            I have been in Canada for almost 2 years and I really love this country. It's beautiful, clean, quite and people in Canada are friendly. The things I love most are watching movie, listening to music and travelling. Also, I prefer to spend my time with my friends. They are the most important part of my life. </p>
            <p>Nowadays, I'm studying at Algonquin College and my program is Computer Engineer Technology - Conmputing Science. It's my second year in my program and I'm looking for the Co-op jobs right now. I love my program because it makes me feel excited when I write code.</p>
